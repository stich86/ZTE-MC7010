# HW revisions (currently known)
There are five different hardware revisions available on the market; some others may also be available, but I've never seen them on my own üòä

| HW Revision         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | mmWave Support | GPS Support |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| MC7010 (w/mmWave)   | These units are sold in various markets (like Italy, by Fastweb/Linkem).  They support 5G mmWave and sub-6GHz, but they only support TDD LTE bands.  They actually miss HW on the board, so there is no way to use them with FDD bands. Crossflashing firmware is not possible.                                                         | ‚úÖ            | N/A |
| MC7010 (Plain Unit) | These units are sold in various markets by ISPs or directly by **ZTE**.  The most commonly found are from *Elisa, Telenor, DNA, Play, TIM Italy, 3 Austria*.  Their firmware can be exchanged between them.  Flashing firmware from **MC7010Ds** on plain **MC7010s** units is not possible, otherwise you will get **"NO SERVICE"**.   | ‚ùå             | ‚úÖ |
| MC7010 (China Unit) | These units are sold only in the Chinese market (but they're easily found on AliExpress).  It is not currently known whether the firmware can be replaced with the firmware from other versions.  Their firmware doesn't work on plain **MC7010** units.                                                                                | ‚ùå             | ‚úÖ |
| MC7010CA            | These units are sold in the Mexican or Canadian markets.  The most commonly found are from Telus, Roger and Telcel. Crossflashing firmware is not possible.                                                                                                                                                                             | ‚ùå             | ‚úÖ |
| MC7010D             | These units are sold in various markets, only by ISPs.  The most commonly found are from *Vodafone Italy, WINDTRE Italy, Orange Poland, H3G UK, Yettel BG*.  Their firmware can be exchanged between them.  Flashing the firmware from plain **MC7010s** on **MC7010D** units is not possible, otherwise you will get **"NO SERVICE"**. | ‚ùå             | ‚ùå |
